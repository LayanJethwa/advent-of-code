# Advent of Code

This repository contains all my solutions to Advent of Code.

I solve them all in Python, but have also used Excel, C and Rust for some, and I am hoping to solve them in more languages to help me learn them!




## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual series of 25 programming challenges (and each apart from the last has 2 parts), that are released in the run-up to Christmas.

The problems are created by the amazing Eric Wastl, and range wildly in difficulty. They are intended to be solvable in a multitude of different programming languages and methods.

For more information, read the [about](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) page on the Advent of Code website.
## Run Locally

For all the Python files, simply:
- Download the file and the contents of the `tools` folder
- Install any dependencies needed (`pip install ...`)
- Download your input from the corresponding [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) page
- Run the Python file!

Excel files can simply be downloaded and opened (my input is pasted into the first column)

Other languages will vary, but you should be able to run them having downloaded the `input.txt` file into the working directory.

# advent-of-code
This repo contains all my solutions to Advent of Code!  
I mainly solve the problems in Python, but I have done a few in Excel, and am beginning to use more languages on top of this.  

Advent of Code is a series of annual programming challenges that are released in the run-up to Christmas each year.  
They range in difficulty, and are intended to be able to be solved with multiple different programming languages.
